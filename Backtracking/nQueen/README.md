# Backtracking Problem

## N Queen Problem

### Problem Statement

N Queens should be placed in an N x N Chess Board such that no queens should attack each other

### Identifying the problem type

Digesting the statement, we can infer that there may be different possible arrangements to place N Queens for multiple solutions.
- Problem does not request for the best solution (Optimization Problem)
- Problem does not request for a solution (Decision Problem)

Therefore we can conclude that this Backtracking problem is searching for all possible solutions (Enumeration)

### Visualizing the Problem

Suppose we chose 4 Queens to be placed in a 4 x 4 Chess Board:
